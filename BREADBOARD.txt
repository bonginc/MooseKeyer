(very rough at this point -- just describing how I have breadboard set up).

- 5V to power rail
- Gnd to ground rail

- Sleeve of jack (TYPE?) to +5V, via resistor
- Left of jack to Gnd, via restior
   - On same row, hookup wire to 7
- Right of jack to Gnd, via resistor
   - On same row, hookup wire to 6
(for testing w/o speaker)
- Pin 5 to LED, LED to ground
   - Pin 5 to 1B
   - +ve terminal of LED in E1
   - -ve termimnal of LED in E4
   - Resistor from B2 to ground rail
