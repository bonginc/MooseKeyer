Moosekeyer is a Arduino-based iambic CW keyer.

Planned features:
- Adjustable WPM
- Memory
- Toggle between keyer and code practice oscilator
- LCD display -- shows WPM, memory output, or entered code based on mode

Apologies in advance for any code quality issues -- this is my first Arduino project
and I'm learning by making mistakes...
