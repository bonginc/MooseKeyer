Moosekeyer is a Arduino-based iambic CW keyer.

Planned features:
    Working on now:
    - Adjustable WPM
    Things to work on still:
    - Memory
    - Toggle between keyer and code practice oscilator
    - LCD display -- shows WPM, memory output, or entered code based on mode

Apologies in advance for any code quality issues -- this is my first Arduino project
and I'm learning by making mistakes...

I've taken over to see if I can make something fun.
